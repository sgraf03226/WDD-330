		<h3 class="readingCategory">Javascript: Novice to Ninja</h3>	
		<h3 class="readingCategory">Chapter 11</h3>
			<p class="readingText"> ~ Functions in JavaScript are first-class functions. This means 
                functions can be passed as arguements to other functions, assigning them to variables, 
                or storing them in data structures.
            </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Once a temporary variable is defined, it is impossible to remove 
                from scope. </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Promise objects represent the eventual completion of an asynchronous 
                operation and it's resulting value. It is a proxy value that might not be known when the promise 
                is created. Those asynchronous functions are callbacks.</p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ There are three Promise states: Pending, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
                Fulfilled, the operation was completed successfully. Rejected, the operation failed.
            </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ The process of turing a single function into a series of functions is called 
                currying. It is the partial application of the functions.</p>
            

        <h3 class="readingCategory">Chapter 13</h3>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ Fetch API is the standard to request/send asynchronous data. 
            It provides fetch() (a global method) that has the arguement of the URL of the wanted resource. 
            This fetch() returns a promise, the response returned from the URL.
        </p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ The Same-Origin Policy is a security concept. It allows a web page to 
            access data from a second web page if they both have the same origin. Otherwise it will block 
            all requests from another page if it has a different origin (domain) from the page making the 
            request. 
        </p>

		<h2 class="reportTitle">Week 7 Report/Scrum Meeting</h2>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I spent this week working on the team activity and learning
                more about AJAX. 
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What am I going to do next?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">Next week I will work to complete week eight's assignments and reading.
            It looks like the focus will be on transforms and transitions.</p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What are my blockers?</h3>
			<p class="reportText"> My blocker this week is balance. Sometimes I get stuck on a concept and my frustration
                towards it keeps me from moving on and coming back to the problem. This leads me to not properly
                complete everything that I need to.
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">Questions</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I was able to resolve all questions on my own this week and even bounced ideas
                and lessons off of my husband to expand my knowledge.</p>

			<p class="readingText"> ~ Primitive data types include strings, numbers, bigints, 
                booleans, undefined, and symbols.</p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Non-primitive data types are objects, arrays, functions, and 
                object laterals. </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ The let keyword declares variables in black scope.
                Block scope means that the variables only exist in that particular block.</p>
                <p class="readingText"> ~ Template literals are useful for interpolation, which
                    allows you to embed an expression within a string. The template literal
                    is a string within backticks and an $() is the place holder.

            <p class="readingText"> ~ There are three different ways to define Javascript functions: Function Declaration, Function Expression,

		<h2 class="reportTitle">Week 2 Report/Scrum Meeting</h2>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I spent this week reviewing Javascript arrays and functions for the most part.
                This week felt pretty straightforward and I didn't really have questions. I also completed the team 
                activity on my own this week since another individual has not joined my group. I am group 6.
                It was nice to see that I did not struggle as much with the activity as I thought I would! I was even able
                to complete the stretch activities on my own and then showed and taught my husband what I did since 
                I didn't have a group member to work with this week. He is a technical artist so was a great sounding board.
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What am I going to do next?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">It looks like next weeks focus is JavaScript objects and that there is a 
                lot of reading so I will start early. If another from the class has not joined my group by Saturday 
                then I will email the teacher to remedy this. I enjoyed placing outside sources in my notes for 
                reference and I hope to continue that practice next week. If I do this correctly, this little index could
                be a great source of notes for me to refer back to.
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What are my blockers?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I did not feel like I encountered any blockers this week. I think that 
                making sure I start the reading early in the week will continue to eleminate blockers that I 
                run into because I will have the time to resolve them.
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">Questions</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I was able to resolve all questions on my own this week and even bounced ideas
                and lessons off of my husband to expand my knowledge.</p>

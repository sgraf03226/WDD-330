		<h3 class="readingCategory">Validating Forms</h3>
			<p class="readingText"> ~ The purpose of client side form validation is to make sure that any data that is 
                submitted through a form online will meet the necessary server requirements. It is important to note though,
                that this should not be the only form of security. However, it does provide some protection for the company's 
                servers as well as the end user.
            </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ With form validation you can make certain parts required to fill out, create a min/max 
                length of characters, or request a type (emails, phone numbers, etc.) </p>
            

        <h3 class="readingCategory">Using Fetch</h3>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ A fetch statement requests data from a website through a link. The response is converted 
            into  a JSON format that can be modified through JS. The data is then logged into the console for the developer to 
            view. The GET request unfortunately does not offer any security. If you would like to add security, use the POST method 
            instead of the GET.
        </p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ Example of Fetch:
            <code>
                fetch('http://example.com/games.json')
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(data => console.log(data));
            </code>
        </p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ Example of POST:
            <code>
                fetch('https://example.com', {
                    credentials: 'include'
                  });
            </code>

		<h2 class="reportTitle">Week 10 Report/Scrum Meeting</h2>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I spent this week working on the team activity and learning
                more about Validating forms and Fetch. I also completed the UI portion of my personal project!
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What am I going to do next?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">Next week I will work to complete week eleven's assignments.
            I will also be working on the API of my personal project! Considering the teacher's notes I will also be
            looking at phone model versions for my personal project.</p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What are my blockers?</h3>
			<p class="reportText"> My blocker this week was realizing I haven't always pushed my assignments to Github
                and turning in the wrong assignments to the wrong classes. I spent most of the week rectifying this and trying
                not to feel overwhelmed!
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">Questions</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I was able to resolve all questions on my own this week and even bounced ideas
                and lessons off of my husband to expand my knowledge.</p>

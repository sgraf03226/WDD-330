			<p class="readingText"> ~ Transforms allow you to rotate, scale or skew elements.
                 Unfortunately transforms do not work on inline elements and you will need to 
                 add display: inline-block.</p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Translation functions allow the movement of elements to the 
                left, right, up, or down. </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Transitions will allow the values of CSS properties to change
                over time (simple animations). CSS animations however, allow control over each step 
                of the animation using keyframes. A keyframe is a snapshot that defines the start 
                or endpoint of smooth transitions.</p>

        <h3 class="readingCategory">Chapter 12</h3>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ To create a canvas element, you must create the element in the element 
            declaration and proide it with an ID, width, and height.
        </p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ Different from canvas, SVG images are readily available through the DOM.
            Becuase SVG's are complex, an image editor (Inkscape) is needed to to create an image.
        </p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~  Event listeners are used for drag and drop options.

		<h2 class="reportTitle">Week 7 Report/Scrum Meeting</h2>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I spent this week working on the team activity and learning
                about transforms, transitions, Canvas and SVGs. I also brushed up on various types
                of event listeners on my own. They are extremely useful. 
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What am I going to do next?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">Next week I will work to complete week nine's assignments and reading.
            It looks like the focus will be on HTML5 APIs and the Window Onject. I will also 
            work on my project proposal.</p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What are my blockers?</h3>
			<p class="reportText"> I felt like this was a better week. I had things under control and
                gave myself plenty of time to complete the assignments. I even got to do some research on
                other topics on my own!
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">Questions</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I was able to resolve all questions on my own this week and even bounced ideas
                and lessons off of my husband to expand my knowledge.</p>

		<h2 class="readingTitle">Reading for Week 1</h2>
		<h3 class="readingCategory">Doing Stuff with Web Things</h3>
			<p class="readingText">This was a useful review. It is scary to me how quickly you forget things but fortunately
                this review helped me recall a lot that I had forgotten. I appriciate the instructions recommending
                that I complete the unassigned reading as well. This review also made me realize I need to plan extra
                time to complete assignments since I might need to relearn some things.
            </p>	
		<h3 class="readingCategory">Master Mobile UX</h3>
			<p class="readingText"> This video had more information in it than I realized. I was surprised by some of the 
                statistics. I had no idea that only 49% of mobile users use one hand. It is important taught
                we as designers know our audience (users). After all what we are building is actually for the users.
                 I would have thought it was higher. I enjoyed the emphasis on reducing download times. There was 
                 also a nice refresher of Do's and Don'ts. Don't use pop-ups or pop-overs, but do use borders
                 for menus. Things like that.
            </p>
        <h3 class="readingCategory">Portfolio</h3>
			<p class="readingText">The instructions were easy to follow and it was a fantastic review. It also made me 
                realize I can't leave these assignments to last minute or I won't do well.
            </p>
        <h3 class="readingCategory">Syllabus</h3>
			<p class="readingText">The syllabus helped me know what tools and skills I should have to be successful in this course. 
                It also showed my what to expect for this class and how each portion is to be completed.

		<h2 class="reportTitle">Week 1 Report/Scrum Meeting</h2>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I spent this week reviewing a lot of what I had learned in previous semesters.
                I also spent a lot of my time working on getting github setup as well as setting
                down the foundation to turn in each weekly assignment. I completed all of the reading 
                and even did some research on my own (part of reviewing what I had learned before).
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What am I going to do next?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">It looks like next weeks focus is JavaScript so I hope to further my 
                knowledge in that area. I'm excited to play around in the code sandbox! I'm hoping to 
                try something new next week, I'm not sure what it is yet but my goal is to implement 
                something that I haven't done before into the week 2 web page.
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What are my blockers?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">My blockers this week were just being rusty in HTML and JavaScript. Fortunately 
                I had the time this week to do a proper review. To avoid running into blockers for 
                next week, I will set aside extra time to do a review should I need one.
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">Questions</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I was able to resolve all questions on my own this week.</p>

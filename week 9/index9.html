		<h3 class="readingCategory">Javascript: Novice to Ninja</h3>	
		<h3 class="readingCategory">Chapter 9</h3>
			<p class="readingText"> ~ You can create global variable without using const, let, or var. 
                It is good to note that you should avoid referencing these global variables using window (window.globalVariable). 
                The reasoning behind this is so that the code is portable between environments.
            </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Confirm() is always a boolean and is dependent on the user's response. Alert() should 
                always return undefined. Prompt() is a string that is dependent on what the user has entered. </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Review window methods.</p>
            

        <h3 class="readingCategory">Chapter 14</h3>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ To embedd data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser, use 
            Javascript and data-attribute. The .getAttribute accesses the data-attributes. 
        </p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ There are different forms of API, the geoLocation API provides the location and speed of 
            a device, where the web storage API provides local storage functionality. To show messages using the system's notifications, 
            use notification API. There is also a canvas API.
        </p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ The protocol websockets allows two-way communication with a server. The server pushes responses
            to the client over an open connection that stays open.
        </p>

        <div class='readingText'>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <button id='windowObject'>Press me to see window example</button>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ The code for this button will work whether there is a window prefix or not!
                This is an example for window objects.
            </p>
            <button id='windowWindow'>Press me to see window example</button>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ The button is an example of a window opening a window. I think
                    I need to work on the resizing, yes it resized well but the image was cut instead of
                    being resized.

		<h2 class="reportTitle">Week 9 Report/Scrum Meeting</h2>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I spent this week working on the team activity and learning
                more about window objects and APIs. The API portion will come in handy for me come
                week 11 when I try to work with them for my personal project. 
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What am I going to do next?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">Next week I will work to complete week ten's assignments and reading.
            It looks like the focus will be validating forms and fetch. I will also be working on the UI
            of my personal project!</p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What are my blockers?</h3>
			<p class="reportText"> My blocker this week was coming up with a personal project, however after
                talking with my husband about bitcoin I was blessed with an idea that I actually will find useful!
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">Questions</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I was able to resolve all questions on my own this week and even bounced ideas
                and lessons off of my husband to expand my knowledge.</p>

		<h3 class="readingCategory">Chapter 5</h3>
			<p class="readingText"> ~ Most of this chapter was review..</p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ JS objects are collections of properties, properties are associations
                between a name and a value. </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ If a properties value is a function, then it is called
                a method. </p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Object literals in JS are a list of name-value pairs seperaated by commas
                and wrapped in curly braces. The purpose of an object literal is to encapsulate data
                and minimize the use of global variables.</p>
            <p class="readingText"> ~ Date object properties require getter and setter methods.</p>
            <div class='readingText'>

                <button onclick="game.start(quiz)">Quiz Ninja</button>
              </div>

        <h3 class="readingCategory">Chapter 6</h3>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ Node lists are similar to arrays but do not use the 
            array methods (splice, slice and join). They can be converted to arrays using the 
            spread operator or Array.form.</p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ Classes in JS can be set using setAttribute() method or using the className property.
            If there are multiple classes, the className property will overwrite those existing classes. Instead, to 
            add a class use classList.add(). You can then turn a class on or off using classList. toggle().</p>

        <h3 class="readingCategory">Chapter 7</h3>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ For event handling, JS uses the non-blocking approach.</p>
        <p class="readingText"> ~ JS has a lot of events, which are reactions in HTML. Here is a quick review and 
            examples of JS events.

		<h2 class="reportTitle">Week 3 Report/Scrum Meeting</h2>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What did I do since the last meeting?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I spent this week reviewing and learning more about JavaScript. I also
                completed the team assignment but since I was in the hospital and could not meet with him we 
                emailed eachother and talked it over. I completed all of the assigned reading and completed some of
                the examples.
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What am I going to do next?</h3>
			<p class="reportText">Next week I will work to complete week four's assignments and reading.
            It looks like the focus will be on JavaScript forms and object oriented programming.</p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">What are my blockers?</h3>
			<p class="reportText"> My blockers this next week will be a foggy mind from heavy pain and nausea medications. To 
                make sure that I understand what I am reading, I will need to read through at least twice and triple check all of 
                the work that I do. I will need to be patient and schedule out extra time in order
                to get everything done and to let the concepts sink in.
            </p>
		<h3 class="reportCategory">Questions</h3>
			<p class="reportText">I was able to resolve all questions on my own this week and even bounced ideas
                and lessons off of my husband to expand my knowledge.</p>
